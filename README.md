# CryptoClustering - Module 19 Challenge Assignment
### Goal of Project:
- Utilize Python and unsupervised learning to predict how price changes affect cryptocurrencies.
### Deliverables:
- Scale the original data
- Calculate inertia and create an elbow curve graph to determine the best k-value
- Use k-means to find the data points' best clusters
- Graph the clusters and color-code based on the k-means predictions
- Use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions being analyzed in the data
- Calculate inertia and create an elbow curve graph for the PCA data to determine the best k-value
- Use k-means to find the PCA data points' best clusters
- Graph the clusters and color-code based on the k-means predictions
- Create two composite graphs to compare the elbow curve graphs and the cluster scatter plots
